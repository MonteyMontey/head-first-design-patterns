// it's so simple, there's no implementation needed (to future dominik: if you can't remember this you're dumb af)
// the facade pattern simply simplifies a process by combining multiple methods from different classes that belong
// together, and creating a Facade Class that calls all those low level methods with fewer higher level methods by composition

// goes well together with the "principle of least knowledge", the client should know the least amount of classes
// possible, ideally only the facade class
